# DrinkingWaterQualityPrediction
In this repository we are presenting our code for the Kaggle Drinking Water Quality Competition with data provided by the Estonian government (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/copy-of-drinking-water-quality)
### `csv` folder contains all the data
### `data_creation.ipynb` file runs the code for making a .csv file out of xml files
### `dwqprediction.ipynb` - first version of our code
### `new_features.ipynb` - second and the final version of our code
### `open_data_analysis.ipynb` - code for the analysis of additional data from xml files

## Our goals:
### Goal 1: To create a model that predicts the water quality on Estonian water stations based on the governmentâ€™s open data
### Goal 2: To make additional feature and data analysis based on additional data
